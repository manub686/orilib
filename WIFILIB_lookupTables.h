//table needed for better than 1kHz resolution is 20000 entries,
//so we create a 15-bit lookup table. Note that this table will
//be 4B * 2^5k = 128KB, and we are creating two such tables, one
//positive, one negative, which will eat up 256KB of L2 space!
//#define DEROT_TABLE_SIZE 				32768
//#define DEROT_TABLE_SIZE_N_BITS		15

//instead, if we want a least count of 1kHz that we can correct,
//to keep the resolution possible, we'll maintain a table good
//for one symbol duration, that is, 80 samples. every symbol
//will be corrected with the same starting point in the table,
//so that each symbol will have a random phase but no cfo. phase
//will then be handled by pilot phase tracking. then, the angle
//granularity required is that of 32768 divisions of [0,1) uniform
//angle range, and we would want to keep the first 80 entries of
//such a table. However, if we want to cater to upto 50kHz of
//maximum cfo, we can extend the table by a factor of 50 samples,
//and then cover it with a proportional stride given the cfo.

//If (least count) angle corresponds to (1/32768) on [0,1) scale,
//we are correcting f = 1/(32768*50ns) = 0.61kHz. So to correct
//50kHz, we need table length 80samples * (50/0.61) = 80 * 83.3,
//or about 6400 samples long, which will occupy 6.25*4kB = 25kB
//per table, which is much more affordable, even for two tables
//together occupying 50kB.
