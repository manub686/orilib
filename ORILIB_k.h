//a longer window will be more stable in
//energy estimates and more robust to variations due to noise, but a smaller window will be more reactive. resilience to
//noise can also be controlled with the agc gain relock threshold (see below), which determines the minimum step size to
//relock. hence, in general, it may work better to keep the window small but threshold higher, since the arrival of packet
//would actually correspond to a sharp rise, thus matching this combination, where noise variations will be exact opposite
//in behavior. the better the agc responds, the less is the distortion in training sequence due to delay in agc reponse,
//and better will be peak correlation values.
//Also note that if the window is shorter and agc responds faster, on an ascending energy curve (as in a windowed reception
//of a packet signal), the agc will end up locking earlier than it would in a longer window, and likely lock to a higher
//gain value, since the gain value is on a descending curve as received power is on an ascending curve. this means it's
//important to keep a higher safety margin in gain value, so that we can accommodate the larger gain value. thus, we still
//get the benefit of quick locking and more uniform gain value across the packet preamble with short window, and avoid
//saturation with higher safety margin.

//agc gain is still estimated based on the average power seen in a window of samples. however, individual samples (instantaneous
//power) may still have higher magnitudes than average power. if the PAPR is high, room must be kept in picking the agc gain so
//that even the peak-samples (in power sense) can be kept undistorted.

//using a margin of 1 could lead to a lot of saturated samples, though peak detection could work better
//3 is the safest, but may require lower peak thresholds because the correlation values will distort more
//and will flatten out the peak, as well as reduce absolute correlation. again, there is a tradeoff with
//agc window size too, as documented above.

#define SYNC_AGC_FURTHER_SAFETY_MARGIN_FOR_ABSOLUTELY_NO_SATURATION		1
//this is a margin on top of agc gain margin picked (possibly aggressively) for peak detection. this margin

#define SYNC_AGC_GAIN_RELOCK_THRESHOLD				3	
//3-bit difference in avg sample norm (norm of avg) to relock
//a higher relock threshold means better stability against noise variations and coarser agc operation, and more stable
//gain during packet preamble reception, since the agc will converge sooner. however, it also means more variation in
//best-possible-gain-value and locked-gain-value, so it will end up preserving less dynamic range. depending on the use
//of samples-with-gain, this may be better to keep tight to cause less loss-of-precision distortion (say, for limited-bit-width
//peak detection), or to keep loose to prevent saturation distortion when dynamic range is sufficient anyway (like for
//actual receive chain, where you don't want to distort samples and degrade SNR).
