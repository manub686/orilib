/** 
 * @brief Descrambles the input using the scrambling sequence stored in the state parameter.
 *
 * Descrambles the input by XOR-ing 64 bits of the input with 64 bits of the scrambling
 * sequence. Using the number of bits scrambled, this function computes which of the
 * 8 shifted scrambling sequences to use in order to start scrambling at the correct
 * bit.
 *
 * @param[in] data_in is the input scrambled bits.
 * @param[in,out] state is a struct that holds bits_scrambled, the data_length and and the scrambling sequences 2D array. 
 * @param[out] data_out is the output descrambled bits*/
